# FROM SCRATCH TO HERO 
## Abdullah Abdulhamid, my nephew, 
has been fascinated by the applications I create and code since he was young.
He dreams of learning programming and often insists on it. 
The journey began when I introduced him to Scratch application and trained him on how to use it. 
The results he achieved were impressive and astonished me. This greatly encouraged me to start teaching him programming, 
with God's help, starting with Java. After his exams, while he was in the first year of preparatory school at Al-Azhar, he came to me,
and I explained some basic language rules to him and had him practice on the computer. From there, the journey began. 
I wanted to document this here so that I can remember it, God willing, when I am proud of him one day as he becomes one of the best software engineers.
